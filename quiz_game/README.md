# A Simple Quiz Game

## This repo is being set up as part of a lecture series in client side Web Development

For each of these files there is a video lecture available. The content is not grouped categorically, rather it progresses in complexity.

 - 01_skeleton ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljYvHLoLhBA)) - the basic html skeleton of our game
 - 02_basic_event ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDgOMfJxlPg)) - preliminary client-side javascript that responds to click events
 - 03_animate_event ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJQxS4b6D4E)) - click events trigger visible changes in the page using the Document Object Model (DOM)
 - 04_an awful game ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVIdW-o7EOY)) - our structure is finally converted to a "game"
 - 05_an_annoying_awful_game ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlV3fIGIs9o)) - the "game" begins to become more game-like
 - 06_stinky_replayable_game ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-iP1SP94gc)) - functionality added for replayability
 - 07_basic_flow_control ([Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxukHJ3zSRU)) - the game lifecycle becomes clearer
 - 08_counting_guesses ([Lecture](https://youtu.be/M_O3p9cs2cE)) - multiple guesses integrated
